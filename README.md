A workout tracker, single-page app, that uses localStorage and it can track two types of workout for user on a map and on a list. I used O.O.P for the architecture.

Additional features that I will implement:

1. Ability to edit a workout
2. Ability to delete a workout
3. Ability to delete all workouts
4. Ability to sort workouts by a certain field
5. Rebuilding objects coming from localStorage
6. More realistic messages
7. Flowchart, architecture, and Classes diagrams
8. ...(for now)
