# Workout Tracker

> This Workout Tracker is a single-page application designed to help users log and visualize their workouts on an interactive map and in a structured list. Built with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the app leverages localStorage to persist workout data across sessions.

## Key Features:

- Track two types of workouts (e.g., running and cycling)
- Display workouts on a map and in a sortable list
- Data persistence using localStorage

## Upcoming Enhancements:

- Delete individual workouts or clear all workouts
- Edit workouts to adjust details
- Sort workouts based on specific criteria
- Restore objects from localStorage after page reload
- More intuitive UI messages for better user experience
- Visual documentation, including flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and class structures
- Ability to position the map to show all workouts
- Ability to draw lines and shapes
- Geocode location from cordinates to show a better description of location (ex: Bury Road in London, England)
- Display weather data for workout time and place

> This project is a work in progress, with continuous improvements planned for better functionality and user experience.
